    """
    Minimization of scalar function of one or more variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Objective function.
    x0 : ndarray
        Initial guess.
    args : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments passed to the objective function and its
        derivatives (Jacobian, Hessian).
    method : str, optional
            - 'BFGS'

    jac : bool or callable, optional
        Jacobian of objective function. Only for CG, BFGS, Newton-CG.
        If `jac` is a Boolean and is True, `fun` is assumed to return the
        value of Jacobian along with the objective function. If False, the
        Jacobian will be estimated numerically.
        `jac` can also be a callable returning the Jacobian of the
        objective. In this case, it must accept the same arguments as `fun`.
    hess, hessp : callable, optional
        Hessian of objective function or Hessian of objective function
        times an arbitrary vector p.  Only for Newton-CG.
        Only one of `hessp` or `hess` needs to be given.  If `hess` is
        provided, then `hessp` will be ignored.  If neither `hess` nor
        `hessp` is provided, then the hessian product will be approximated
        using finite differences on `jac`. `hessp` must compute the Hessian
        times an arbitrary vector.
    bounds : sequence, optional
        Bounds for variables (only for L-BFGS-B, TNC, COBYLA and SLSQP).
        ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``, defining
        the bounds on that parameter. Use None for one of ``min`` or
        ``max`` when there is no bound in that direction.
    constraints : dict or sequence of dict, optional
        Constraints definition (only for COBYLA and SLSQP).
        Each constraint is defined in a dictionary with fields:
            type : str
                Constraint type: 'eq' for equality, 'ineq' for inequality.
            fun : callable
                The function defining the constraint.
            jac : callable, optional
                The Jacobian of `fun` (only for SLSQP).
            args : sequence, optional
                Extra arguments to be passed to the function and Jacobian.
        Equality constraint means that the constraint function result is to
        be zero whereas inequality means that it is to be non-negative.
        Note that COBYLA only supports inequality constraints.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination. For detailed control, use solver-specific
        options.
    options : dict, optional
        A dictionary of solver options. All methods accept the following
        generic options:
            maxiter : int
                Maximum number of iterations to perform.
            disp : bool
                Set to True to print convergence messages.
        For method-specific options, see `show_options('minimize', method)`.
    callback : callable, optional
        Called after each iteration, as ``callback(xk)``, where ``xk`` is the
        current parameter vector.

    Returns
    -------
    res : Result
        The optimization result represented as a ``Result`` object.
        Important attributes are: ``x`` the solution array, ``success`` a
        Boolean flag indicating if the optimizer exited successfully and
        ``message`` which describes the cause of the termination. See
        `Result` for a description of other attributes.


    Method *BFGS* uses the quasi-Newton method of Broyden, Fletcher,
    Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS) [5]_ pp. 136. It uses the first derivatives
    only. BFGS has proven good performance even for non-smooth
    optimizations
